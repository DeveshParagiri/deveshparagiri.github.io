Hey! I'm **Dev**, a rising senior at the University of Maryland, majoring in Computer Science.

My work lives at the intersection of AI, ML, Data Science, and Web Development with a growing focus on generative AI applications and real-world impact through technology.

I'm currently pursuing undergraduate research under **[Dr. George Hurtt](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wr0aDMEAAAAJ&hl=en)** at the **[Global Ecology Lab](https://gel.umd.edu/)** where I’m building models to analyze ecological change across space and time using high-resolution remote sensing data.

Previously, I was a **Software Engineer** at **[hushh.ai](https://hush1one.com)**, specializing in API development and creating robust data collection and processing systems for their products.

Beyond tech, I’m into travel, fitness, soccer, and skateboarding and I’m always down for exploring new places and ideas.

Feel free to reach out at `devesh.paragiri@gmail.com`!
