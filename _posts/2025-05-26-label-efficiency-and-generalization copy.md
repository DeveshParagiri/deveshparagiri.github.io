## **Overview**

This experiment investigates how accurately I can classify individual pixels in aerial imagery as **LIVE**, **DEAD**, or **BARE** ground using a small number of labeled examples. I evaluate how performance scales with label count, examine the benefit of including **NDVI** as an explicit input feature, and explore how well a model trained on **multi-year data** generalizes across time.

I aim to answer the following core questions:

1. How many labeled pixels per class are needed to achieve high accuracy?
2. Does adding NDVI improve model stability and performance in low-data regimes?
3. Can a model trained on a single year generalize to another year?
4. How well does a model trained on labeled data from all years perform when evaluated across time?

---

<br>
## **Data and Setup**

- All pixels were extracted from spectrally and spatially normalized NAIP imagery (2014–2022).
- Manual labels were created by visually inspecting .png previews across years for each sampled coordinate.
- Each labeled pixel was represented using either:
  - **4-band spectral input**: Red, Green, Blue, NIR
  - **5-band input**: Red, Green, Blue, NIR, NDVI

The model used in all experiments is a RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.

---

## **Experiment 1: Accuracy vs Label Count (With and Without NDVI)**

I trained the classifier using only labeled pixels from **2014**. For each value of k (samples per class), I ran 5 randomized 80/20 train-test splits and recorded mean accuracy and standard deviation.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/label_efficiency_and_generalization/accuracy_simple.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true caption="Accuracy vs Label Count (Without NDVI)" %}

    </div>
</div>

### **Results Summary**

| **Labeled/Class (k)** | **Accuracy (w/o NDVI)** | **Accuracy (w/ NDVI)** |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 5                     | ~52% ± high variance    | ~74% ± lower variance  |
| 8                     | ~65%                    | ~77%                   |
| 13                    | ~75%                    | **~85%**               |

In the first experiment, I found that adding NDVI to the input significantly improves model performance, especially at low sample counts.
<br>

##### **Key Takeaways:**

- NDVI significantly boosts accuracy, especially at **low sample counts**
- Including NDVI stabilizes model performance across random splits
- Without NDVI, the model struggles to distinguish classes under limited supervision
- With NDVI, LIVE pixels are often learned with high confidence even with 5–6 examples

## **Experiment 2: Cross-Year Generalization (Train on 2014 → Test on 2020)**

I trained a model on all 2014-labeled pixels (using 5-band input with NDVI) and tested it directly on labeled pixels from 2020 — no retraining or adaptation.

**Results:**

- **Overall Accuracy**: **78.4%**
- **LIVE** class had high precision and recall
- **BARE** was consistently predicted correctly (recall = 1.0), though with some over-prediction
- **DEAD** remained harder to capture (recall = 0.53)

```
Classification Report:
              precision    recall  f1-score
    BARE         0.571     1.000     0.727
    DEAD         0.818     0.529     0.643
    LIVE         0.885     0.885     0.885
```

## **Implications**

- **NDVI improves generalization** by providing a vegetation-specific signal that remains valid across years.
- The model is most confident on **LIVE** pixels, suggesting that greenness + NDVI are strong predictors.
- **DEAD** and **BARE** are more difficult to distinguish — these likely require:
  - More training samples
  - Spatial or temporal context (e.g., adjacent pixels, change over time)

---

<br>
## **Conclusions**

- Based on this experiment, with as few as **10–13 labeled pixels per class**, we can reach **>85% accuracy** using NDVI.
- Training on one year and applying to another is feasible if the data is normalized.
- NDVI should be included as a feature — it boosts performance significantly and reduces label burden.

---

<br>
## **Next Steps**

- Increase label count across years
- Test reverse generalization: 2020 → 2014
- Predict full raster maps using trained models
- Potentially Add 3×3 or 5×5 patch-based context around each pixel

---

<br>
## **Experiment 3: Combined-Year Generalization and Evaluation**

In this experiment, I explored how well a model trained on **labeled pixels from all years combined** performs across time. Rather than training on a single year, I sampled `k = 10–25` pixels per class (LIVE, DEAD, BARE) from the full labeled dataset and tested the model in two complementary ways:

1. **Per-Year Generalization:** Test accuracy is measured individually on each year (2014–2022).
2. **80/20 Mixed-Year Accuracy:** A stratified 80/20 split is used across all labeled data, simulating a more randomized evaluation.

### **Label Distribution**

Before running this experiment, I reviewed how labeled samples were distributed across years and classes:

| **Year**  | **LIVE** | **DEAD** | **BARE** | **Label Count Range (max - min)** |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| **2014**  | 19       | 19       | 13       | 6                                 |
| **2016**  | 30       | 13       | 8        | 22                                |
| **2018**  | 15       | 12       | 24       | 12                                |
| **2020**  | 26       | 17       | 8        | 18                                |
| **2022**  | 16       | 16       | 19       | 3                                 |
| **Total** | **106**  | **77**   | **72**   |                                   |

While the class imbalance isn’t extreme, some years (like 2016 and 2020) had disproportionately more LIVE samples than BARE or DEAD. This may partially explain performance variation across years.

<br>
### **Graph 1: Accuracy per Year (Trained on All Years)**

I trained the model on all years using k samples per class and evaluated it year-by-year to assess generalization over time.
<br>

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/label_efficiency_and_generalization/generalized_all.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true caption="Generalized Model applied to each year" %}
    </div>
</div>

**Observations:**

- Accuracy improves with label count but flattens after ~20 samples/class.
- **2022 consistently outperformed other years**, reaching over 90% accuracy.
- 2014 and 2016 showed slightly lower accuracy, likely due to noisier labels or less distinctive spectral features.

---

<br>
### **Graph 2: Accuracy vs k (80/20 Random Split)**

For comparison, I also performed a standard 80/20 train-test split on the full dataset.
<br>

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/label_efficiency_and_generalization/generalized_8020.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true caption="Generalized Model Accuracy vs k" %}
    </div>
</div>

**Observations:**

- Accuracy was more variable at lower k values due to randomness in class composition.
- With 20+ samples per class, performance stabilized and closely matched the per-year evaluation curve.

---

<br>

### **Confusion Matrices per Year**

To better understand how each class was predicted over time, I generated confusion matrices for each year using the model trained on all data (k=25 per class).
<br>

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/label_efficiency_and_generalization/confusion_all.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true caption="Confusion Matrix for Generalized Model Applied to Each Year" %}
    </div>
</div>

---

<br>

### **Per-Year Breakdown**

| **Year** | **Accuracy** | **F1 (LIVE)** | **F1 (DEAD)** | **F1 (BARE)** |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **2014** | 0.837        | 0.778         | 0.878         | 0.741         |
| **2016** | 0.867        | 0.778         | 0.923         | 0.667         |
| **2018** | 0.898        | 0.786         | 0.846         | 0.957         |
| **2020** | 0.875        | 0.846         | 0.903         | 0.778         |
| **2022** | **0.901**    | 0.786         | 0.824         | **1.000**     |

<br>

### **Analysis and Hypotheses**

- **LIVE pixels were consistently learned well** across all years, with F1 scores between 0.77–0.85.
- **BARE improved sharply in later years**, especially in 2022 where it reached perfect precision and recall.
- **DEAD remained the most ambiguous**, frequently confused with both LIVE and BARE. Its spectral profile is more variable and likely requires additional temporal or spatial information.
- **2022 performed best**, possibly due to:
  - Balanced label distribution across all classes (All three classes are within a 3-count range)
  - Better image quality or spectral separation
  - Fewer mislabels from manual annotation

> The generalized model’s consistent performance across years confirms that the **spatial and spectral normalization approach** was effective.

### **How Many Labels Are Enough?**

From all experiments, I observed that performance gains are **nonlinear** with respect to label count (logarithmic):

- The steepest gains occur between 5 and 15 samples/class.
- Accuracy improvements **flatten beyond ~20 samples/class**, suggesting diminishing returns.
- For robust, multi-year generalization:
  - **20–25 samples/class** per year is ideal
  - Alternatively, ~100 well-distributed samples/class across years can generalize effectively

---

<br>

### **Takeaways**

- Combined-year training leads to a **stable, high-performing model** across time.
- **NDVI continues to be critical**, especially for identifying LIVE vegetation.
- **Confusion patterns reveal that DEAD remains the weakest class**, needing more contextual signals.
- Training on all available data provides stronger generalization than per-year splits or single-year baselines.

---

<br>

### **Next Steps**

- Increase the number of labeled pixels per class to 30–40 to further reduce variance.
- Investigate spatial context by incorporating patch-level features (e.g., 3×3 or 5×5 neighborhoods).
