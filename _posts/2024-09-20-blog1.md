## **Introduction**

You’ve successfully built your application, and now you’re looking forward to deploying it! This blog covers the basics of **AWS EC2**, setup, and deployment.
<br>
<br>

## **Setup an AWS EC2 Instance**

<br>
### **What even is EC2?**

**EC2** stands for **Elastic Cloud Compute** and is a virtual machine where you can deploy your applications. What's so cool about it? It allows for easy **scaling** to handle more requests coming into your application when the need arises, making it easy to handle varying demand. It’s also quite versatile, making it a great choice for developers.

    </div>
</div>

### **Why are we using it?**

It’s simple, ease of use, and quick setup makes it a great first choice for those getting started with development. Above all, it's cheap because of **“on-demand” scaling** helping to only pull out the big guns when absolutely required. Alternatively, we could also use an **Azure VM** or the **Google Cloud Engine (GCE)** to deploy our app, which I will cover in later blogs.

<br>
### **Getting Started**

Let's set up the AWS instance and connect to it via **SSH**.

#### 1. Login to your AWS account (Root User)

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/blog1/awslogin.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>
<br>

#### 2. Launching an instance

Under the **EC2**, choose **launch instance**. For this application, we will use **AWS Linux** as our OS Image due to its tight integration with AWS and ease of use. Alternatively, you could also use **Ubuntu** but will have to make some changes (`apt-get` vs. `yum`) for the next steps during installing dependencies.

Choose **t2.micro** for instance type – simplest instance, and is very cost effective. If your application is quite large and compute intensive, shift to **t2.medium** for ensuring enough memory capacity.

We create a new **key pair**, which will enable us to connect to our instance through **SSH** and get started with setting up. A `.pem` file will be downloaded to your local machine.

  <div class="row mt-3">
      <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
          {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/blog1/awskeypair.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
      </div>
  </div>

We allow all traffic, so we can access the instance from anywhere. We will be adding some inbound rules later on to make our port accessible to the public DNS.

  <div class="row mt-3">
      <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
          {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/blog1/awsnetwork.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
      </div>
  </div>
<br>

#### 3. Connecting to Instance (SSH)

To connect, you must first download the `.pem` file from when you set up the EC2 instance. Execute the below commands.

```bash
chmod 400 <path/to/security-key.pem> #read permissions

ssh -i <path/to/security-key.pem> ec2-user@ec2-<Ipv4 Address>.compute.amazonaws.com
```

## **Installing Dependencies**

The dependencies we will require include:

- node
- git
- nginx
- pm2

Ensure all packages are up-to-date

Ensure all packages are up-to-date

```bash
sudo yum upgrade && sudo yum update
```

```bash
# Installing Node

curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm install node

node -v
# v22.9.0
```

```bash
# Installing and Setting up Git

yum install git -y

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your email"
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
ssh -T git@github.com

git clone <Your Repository>
```

```bash
# Installing pm2 and nginx

npm install -g pm2

sudo yum install nginx -y
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

<br>

## **Deployment**

We will use nginx as a reverse proxy forwarding all inbound calls from port 80 to our application. For now, we will only focus on HTTP. Now, under `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` modify the `default` config.

```bash
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-server-ip-or-domain;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000; # Replace with your app's port
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

We test the nginx config and restart to apply new changes.

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

To learn more about nginx, refer this [guide](https://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html).

Finally, we use pm2 to ensure that the application runs continuously and restarts automatically if it crashes.

```bash
pm2 start app.js --name "my-app" # Replace `app.js` with your main file name
pm2 save

pm2 list # Shows if the app is running
pm2 log # Check deployment log

pm2 save # Save process list to enable auto-restart on server reboot
pm2 startup systemd # Generate startup script for reboot
```

You should now be able to access the application through the `Ipv4` DNS of your server!
