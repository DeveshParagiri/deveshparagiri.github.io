## **Introduction**

The US-MPJ site has exhibited conflicting trends in ecosystem productivity from 2010 onward. While ED-LiDAR reconstructions indicate stable or rising productivity, both Landsat NDVI and AmeriFlux tower observations (GPP) show a marked decline. This divergence raises a key question: Is rapid, large-scale canopy mortality being missed by traditional models?

To investigate, we developed a lightweight image-based classifier using high-resolution NAIP aerial imagery to directly detect tree mortality. We then analyzed class transitions across time (2014–2022) and validated findings against tower-based GPP observations.

## **Model Retraining with Updated Labels**

We curated a refined labeled dataset of 1500 high-confidence samples across three classes:

- **LIVE**, **DEAD**, and **BARE**
- Labeling combined NDVI-based filtering and visual inspection across 5 NAIP years

##### **Feature Extraction**

For each pixel, we extracted:

- Red, Green, Blue, NIR
- NDVI = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)

##### **Classifier Details**

- **Model**: Random Forest (100 trees)
- **Sampling**: Stratified 80/20 train-test split
- **Balancing**: Class weights set to "balanced"

##### **Evaluation**

- **Accuracy**: 0.838
- **Classification Report**:

```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support
       LIVE       0.86      0.81      0.83        31
       DEAD       0.75      0.78      0.77        23
       BARE       0.90      0.95      0.93        20
```

## **Temporal Transition Analysis (2014–2022)**

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/model_eval/predictions.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true caption="Figure 1 – Heatmap of Plausibility (Simple Score) Across Fixed Drift Combinations" %}
    </div>
</div>

- For each pair of years, we exhaustively tested 625 spatial drift combinations
- Selected configuration minimizing biologically implausible transitions (e.g., DEAD → BARE)

| Year Pair   | Best Drift   | Notes                          |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| 2014 → 2016 | (0, 3, 0, 4) | Minor LIVE → DEAD, DEAD → BARE |
| 2016 → 2018 | (0, 3, 0, 2) | Significant DEAD → BARE        |
| 2018 → 2020 | (0, 0, 0, 1) | LIVE → LIVE recovery pattern   |
| 2020 → 2022 | (0, 1, 0, 0) | BARE plateaued                 |

<br>
#### **Observations**

- The 2016–2018 period shows the most pronounced shift toward BARE
- Post-2020 suggests stabilization

## **Pixel Class Trends Over Time**

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/model_eval/r.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true caption="Figure 2 – Raster Trend" %}
    </div>
</div>

**Confidence Intervals:** Based on classifier precision (LIVE: 95%, DEAD: 62%, BARE: 87%)

#### **Trend Summary**

- **BARE**: Steady increase throughout
- **DEAD**: Falls after 2018, partial rebound by 2022
- **LIVE**: Rises until 2020, then declines sharply

## **Cross-Validation with AmeriFlux GPP**

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/model_eval/gpp.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true caption="Figure 3 – GPP vs Model" %}
    </div>
</div>

This analysis is based on AmeriFlux GPP data from the US-MPJ site.

#### **Correlation**

- Spearman ρ = **-0.800**, p = 0.200 (n = 4)
- Moderate-to-strong negative trend between canopy loss and productivity

#### **Interpretation**

- Despite small sample size, the directionality supports hypothesis
- BARE% rise coincides with sharp GPP fall (2016–2020)

---

<br>
## **Discussion**

- **Drift correction** improves temporal consistency in pixel-wise transitions
- **Model confidence** (especially for BARE) lends weight to ecological interpretation
- **ED-LiDAR reconstructions** likely miss rapid disturbance pulses

**Limitations**

- Spatial resolution mismatch between tower and NAIP raster
- Small test set; more ground truth would improve model robustness

---

<br>
## **Conclusion**

Our approach demonstrates that lightweight, image-based classifiers can reveal large-scale canopy mortality trends consistent with independent tower and satellite records. These models offer a promising supplement to traditional ecological reconstructions.

#### **Next Steps**

- Apply SIFT for more complex transition matching
- Validate with 2022 AmeriFlux GPP
- Package the tool for broader deployment in mortality monitoring
